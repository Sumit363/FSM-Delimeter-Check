# FSM-Delimeter-Check
This Program will take an input string from the user and use the Finite State Machine  to process the string to determine if all delimiters match correctly or not.  The string delimiters are curly braces, parentheses, and square brackets. Note: This is my DATA STRUCTURE Class Assignment. so please use only for the Learning Purpose.
